**Computer Science Student | Aspiring Software Developer**

I am a Computer Science student with a strong passion for coding and problem-solving. I enjoy building applications from the ground up—starting from understanding the problem, designing solutions, and implementing them through clean and efficient code.

I am continuously learning and improving my skills by working on academic projects, personal projects, and hands-on practice. My goal is to grow as a developer who can create practical, real-world solutions using technology.
